Coinbase_lwt is a module of lwt friendly bindings to the Coinbase REST API.
It is setup as a functor that will take a module of Coinbase user account information.

It has the following dependencies:
Lwt
Lwt.syntax
Yojson
Base64
Uri
Cryptokit
Cohttp
Core

Generate all of the Coinbase API bindings for from user account information as follows:

module MyAccountInfo : AccountInfo =
  struct
    let username = "username_goes_here"
    let passphrase = "passphrase_goes_here"
    let api_key = "api_key_goes_here"
    let secret_key = "secret_key_goes_here"
  end

module CoinbaseAPI = Make (MyAccountInfo)

Then all of the Coinbase API functions can be called from the CoinbaseAPI module.

PLEASE NOTE: The Coinbase API is rapidly changing, you may likely run into errors.
